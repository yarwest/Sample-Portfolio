# Sample-Portfolio
This is a sample portfolio page that I will use to show my potential clients and I will showcase on my personal portfolio.
I will not go into too much depth when it come to the technology that is behind this web application. What I will say is that it is based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), HTML, [Bootstap](http://getbootstrap.com/)(using the [Darkly theme](https://bootswatch.com/darkly/)) and [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/).

#Examples
Here are some screenshots of the application
